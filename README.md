# sshd-lite

A feature-light Secure Shell Daemon `sshd(8)` written in Go (Golang). A slightly more practical version of the SSH daemon described in this blog post http://blog.gopheracademy.com/go-and-ssh/. **Warning, this is beta software**.

Client

```sh
$ ssh john@localhost -p 2200

### Usage

```
$ sshd-lite --help
```

<!--tmpl,code=plain:echo "$ sshd-lite --help" && go run main.go --help | sed 's#0.0.0-src#X.Y.Z#' -->
``` plain 
$ sshd-lite --help
exit status 1

  Usage: sshd-lite [options] <auth>

  Version: X.Y.Z

  Options:
    --host, listening interface (defaults to all)
    --port -p, listening port (defaults to 22, then fallsback to 2200)
    --shell, the type of to use shell for remote sessions (defaults to $SHELL, then bash/powershell)
    --keyfile, a filepath to an private key (for example, an 'id_rsa' file)
    --keyseed, a string to use to seed key generation
    --noenv, ignore environment variables provided by the client
    --version, display version
    -v, verbose logs

  <auth> must be set to one of:
    1. a username and password string separated by a colon ("user:pass")
    2. a path to an ssh authorized keys file ("~/.ssh/authorized_keys")
    3. "none" to disable client authentication :WARNING: very insecure

  Notes:
    * if no keyfile and no keyseed are set, a random RSA2048 key is used
    * once authenticated, clients will login to a shell as the
    sshd-lite user. sshd-lite does not lookup system users.
    * sshd-lite only supports remotes shells. tunnelling and command
    execution are not currently supported.
